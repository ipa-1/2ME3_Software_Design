Course Description <br/>
This course introduces students to the profession of software engineering and the software
development process. In particular, students will gain a appreciation of software design strategies
that facilitate working on large applications with multiple developers. Students will study the basic
principles of software design, focusing on software modularization and software units (modules/classes/
components) that are small, sequential and terminating. They will learn how to use precise specifications
to design, implement, and verify (Test/review/inspect) software units in the programming languages
Python and C++. Later courses will teach how to specify and design large software systems that may 
be concurrent and nonterminating.
